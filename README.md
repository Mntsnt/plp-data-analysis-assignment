# Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas & Matplotlib

This project is a simple data analysis and visualization assignment using **Pandas** for data manipulation 
and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for plotting. The dataset used is the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset in machine learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Load and explore a dataset using Pandas
- Perform basic descriptive statistics and group analysis
- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Draw meaningful insights from the results

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations Included
1. Line Chart â€“ Sepal length trend by species
2. Bar Chart â€“ Average petal length per species
3. Histogram â€“ Distribution of sepal width
4. Scatter Plot â€“ Relationship between sepal length and petal length

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-assignment.git
   cd data-analysis-assignment

2. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook Pandas_Matplotlib_Assignment.ipynb

3. Run the cells step by step.

## âœ… Findings
- Setosa species has the smallest petal size.
- Virginica species has the largest petals overall.
- There is a positive correlation between sepal length and petal length.
- Sepal width is approximately normally distributed.
